# Designing GNOME Mobile

Slides for my GUADEC 2018 talk about GNOME Mobile.

### Abstract:

Purism's Librem 5 is the first phone built from the ground up to respect user freedom and privacy. It will run PureOS, a real GNU/Linux distribution, and use GNOME as its user interface. But how is that possible? GNOME doesn't run on phones, does it?

Well, not quite yet, but at Purism we're working on changing that. In my role as designer on the Librem 5 project I'm adapting the design of existing GNOME apps to the phone form factor, and designing new apps from scratch. We want as much of this work as possible to go upstream, in order to benefit all GNOME users.

In this presentation I'll show some of the progress we've been making, and talk about how to design GNOME apps that work well across different form factors.
